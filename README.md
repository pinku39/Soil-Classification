# Soil Type Classification using Deep Learning üå±üîç

This project classifies soil types using deep learning techniques. The model predicts soil type from images.



## Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt 
git clone https://github.com/pinku/soil-type-classification.git
cd soil-type-classification


## Usage
## Dataset Preparation
The dataset contains images of various soil types.
Organize the data into folders for each soil type:
Black Soil
Cinder Soil
Laterite Soil
Peat Soil
Yellow Soil
## Training the Model
Run the train_model.py script to train the deep learning model.
Adjust hyperparameters in the script as needed.
## Evaluating the Model
Evaluate the model's performance using the test dataset.
## Making Predictions
Use the trained model to make predictions on new images.
Run predict_soil_type.py and provide the path to the image.
## Model Details
The model architecture is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
It consists of several convolutional and pooling layers followed by dense layers.
The model uses the RMSprop optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.
## Results
Training Accuracy :96%
